# ChemE-5440-Prelim_1

## 1.
The majority of Problem 1 was completed in the first sheet of the excel file, 
[prelim_1.xlsx](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Prelim_1/blob/master/prelim_1/prelim_1.xlsx). 
[Problem 1.pdf](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Prelim_1/blob/master/prelim_1/Problem%202.pdf) contains Problem 1 **part b)** 
and some supplemental hand written work for **parts a) and c)**.

## 2.
[Problem 2.pdf](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Prelim_1/blob/master/prelim_1/Problem%202.pdf) contains complete solutions
for **parts a), b), and f)**, as well as other handwritten work. **Part c)** was completed in the second sheet of the excel file, [prelim_1.xlsx](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Prelim_1/blob/master/prelim_1/prelim_1.xlsx).
The folder [2d](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Prelim_1/tree/master/prelim_1/2d0) contains all of **part d)**, which was done entirely in Juia for the three specified values of S.The three plots of X vs. S are included as png files in the folder. 
**Part e)**, which can be found in the folder [2e](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Prelim_1/tree/master/prelim_1/2e) was done 
using both excel and Julia. The steady state solutions for the signal value below the Hopf bifurcation nodeand above the saddle 
node were computed in excel on the third sheet and were used to compute the initial values of gene expression for cells 1,2 and 3.
The X vs. time plots were then generated by running the Julia script [Problem_2e*.jl](https://github.com/lenareeb/ChemE-5440-Prelim_1/blob/master/prelim_1/2e/Problem_2e*.jl) with different initialconditions as specified in the excel file. The six plots of Z 
vs. time are included as png files in the folder. An explanation of the oscillations is provided in Problem 2.pdf.
